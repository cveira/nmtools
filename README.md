# NMTools
The “Network Management Tools” complete OpenSLIM CMDB capabilities with Network Discovery, Data Collection, Automation and Configuration Management. Designed for Extensibility, the result is not only a Network Toolset, but a Framework for building quick solutions upon it.

Both tools can work autonomously or together: its a matter of choice and circumstances. This solution is based on Microsoft Access, SQL Server and PowerShell. Certain NMTools modules may require third party tools like: PuTTY, PsTools, Net-SNMP, NMap, Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer or many others. Those dependencies are managed on a per-module basis.

NMTools is a ThinkInBig project and can be reached at: https://thinkinbig.org/.
