A. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
   =============================================================================

1. A working PowerShell v2 installation configured to run scripts. The full
   Windows Management Framework is recommended.

2. Optional, but recommended, a working OpenSLIM installation.

3. If you are going to host the NMAgent Session Stores in SQL Server
   (recommended), you will also need a working instance of SQL Server 2005 or
   higher.

   A common practice is to use the same one you might be using to host the
   OpenSLIM database.
   
4. If you are going to host the NMAgent Session Stores in SQL Server, make sure
   your system has a working Microsoft Jet Database Engine 4.0 SP8.

5. The latest package of the "PsTools", from SysInternals.

   http://download.sysinternals.com/Files/PsTools.zip



B. INITIAL CONFIGURATION STEPS:
   =============================================================================
   
1. Decompress NMTools package (C:\NMAgent, for example).

2. Download the latest Sysinternals PsTools package from:

   http://download.sysinternals.com/Files/PsTools.zip
   
3. Decompress PsTools.zip into the .\bin folder.

4. Set up the profile settings files in the .\settings folder. The most
   important parameters are the following:

   $AgentUserId           = 18              # Use your OpenSLIM Contact UserId
   $AgentUserName         = 'cveira'        #
   $AgentUserSessionStore = '_SessionStore' # Or, 'cveira' as soon as your
                                            # personal SessionStore is ready.
                                            # Refer to "Section E" for more
                                            # information on this topic.

   $NMAgentDbType         = "ms-sql-server" # "<ms-access|ms-sql-server>"

   $NMAgentDbServer       = "YourSqlServer.corp\YourInstance"
   $NMAgentDbName         = "NMAgent"
   $NMAgentDbUserName     = ""              # Leave it blank to use your Windows
                                            # Security Context.
   $NMAgentDbPassword     = ""

   $OpenSLIMDbServer      = "YourSqlServer.corp\YourInstance"
   $OpenSLIMDbName        = "OpenSLIM-current"
   $OpenSLIMDbUserName    = ""              # Leave it blank to use your Windows
                                            # Security Context.
   $OpenSLIMDbPassword    = ""
   
   - It is important to do it in ALL your "settings-<ProfileName>.ps1" files.
     Specially in "settings-main.ps1", which is the one that is use as the
     default profile.

5. Create a credentials file on .\auth\_settings:

   - You can use the contents of .\auth\_settings\_credentials.ps1.sample file
     as a reference for creating your file.
     
   - Refer for "Section D" ("Security Considerations") for further information.
   
   - It is strongly recommended to use the .\EncryptCredendtials.ps1 script
     to protect your credentials.
     
   - If you don't create a credentials file, make sure to disable Brute Force
     Login and MultiCredential facilities in your ALL your profile settings
     files:
     
     $BruteForceLoginMode = $false
     $MultiCredentialMode = $false
     
     These settings will force the NMAgent to ask you for the password assigned
     to the user defined in the following variable:
     
     $NetworkUserId       = "Administrator"



C. SQL SERVER CONFIGURATION STEPS:
   =============================================================================

1. Restore .\NMAgent-FullBackup-20101211-1.bak on a SQL Server of choice.

   - I would suggest to use the same server where the OpenSLIM database is
     hosted.

2. Be sure to verify connectivity between the NMAgent Node (the server in which
   you are installing the NMTools) and the SQL Server:
   routing, firewall rules, etc.

3. Set up SQL Server security accordingly.

   - I would suggest to use Trusted Authentication wherever is possible.
   - If that's not an option for whatever reason, there is a predefined
     sql user "nmagent" that you can re-use/re-create for your own
     purposes.
   - Security Settings should be applied, not only to the NMAgent database, but
     also to the OpenSLIM one.

4. Create an ODBC System Data Source to verify your SQL connectivity. This step
   is optional but recommended. This Data Source is not needed, therefore, you
   can delete it after you have run the connection testing procedure.



D. NMAGENT SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
   =============================================================================

There are certain files and folders that should be protected from unauthorized
access because they contain or might contain sensitive information. Those
objects are:

  1. your Credentials files:
  
     - .\auth\_settings\credentials.ps1
     - .\modules\<LibraryName>\_settings\credentials.ps1

  2. the logs directory: .\logs
  
  3. the export directory: .\export

General Windows Security Hardening techniques apply depending, of course, on
your particular case. Nevertheless, there are some big security measures that
you can try:

  1. Set up ACLs in NTFS accordingly.
  
  2. Set up NTFS auditing accordingly.
  
  3. Set up Monitoring and Alerts on the Windows Security Events that
     correspond to your auditing settings.

  4. Use the .\EncryptCredendtials.ps1 script to protect your credentials file
     through the Windows DPAPI and DELETE the original credentials.ps1 with
     a Secure File Wiping utility.



E. CREATING YOUR PERSONAL SESSION STORE:
   =============================================================================
   
1. If you haven't run any Session and save it in your Session Store, do it for
   the first time:
   
   - Go to the "OpenSLIM" library (.\modules\openslim), copy one module and
     paste it on its "_enabled" folder (.\modules\openslim\_enabled).
     
   > Choose a Target Computer and run an NMAgent session against it:
   
     PS C:\NMAgent> .\nmagent.ps1 run -profile openslim -node YourNodeName -save
     
   - Clean your .\modules\openslim\_enabled empty after the execution.
   
2. If you already have Session Data stored in the default Session Store, you
   can start the procedure from here:
     
   - Verify that your Session has been saved correctly:
   
     PS C:\NMAgent> .\nmagent.ps1 query
     
   > Archive this Session into a new off-line Session Store:

     PS C:\NMAgent> .\nmagent.ps1 archive -store cveira
     
   - Verify that your new Session Store has been created correctly:

     PS C:\NMAgent> .\nmagent.ps1 list -store none
     
   - Verify that your Session has been archived correctly:

     PS C:\NMAgent> .\nmagent.ps1 query -store cveira

   > Change the value for $AgentUserSessionStore in your profile settings files
     so that you can use the new Session Store as your primary Session Store. It
     is important to do it in ALL your "settings-<ProfileName>.ps1" files.
     Specially in "settings-main.ps1", which is the one that is use as the
     default profile:
     
     $AgentUserSessionStore = 'cveira'
     
   - Verify that your new settings are working:

     PS C:\NMAgent> .\nmagent.ps1 query
     
   - Verify that you can still access your previous Session Store:

     PS C:\NMAgent> .\nmagent.ps1 query -store _SessionStore
